# AdventOfElixir2019

My Elixir solutions to [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019). Some things to know about that:

* I haven't used Elixir in 2 years
* I wasn't very good at Elixir back then either, I was just learning it
* I'm currently recovering from a head injury

So please don't assume any of these solutions are good examples of how to do something in Elixir. I love getting feedback though, so I can learn how to do things better. Feel free to let me know your thoughts.
